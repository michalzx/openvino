# Supported Devices

The OpenVINO™ runtime enables you to use the following devices to run your
deep learning models:
[CPU](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/cpu-device),
[GPU](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/gpu-device),
[NPU](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/npu-device).

For their usage guides, see [Devices and Modes](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes).  
For a detailed list of devices, see [System Requirements](../../about-openvino/release-notes-openvino/system-requirements).

Beside running inference with a specific device,
OpenVINO offers the option of running automated inference with the following inference modes:

[Automatic Device Selection](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/auto-device-selection):  
automatically selects the best device available for the given task. It offers many
additional options and optimizations, including inference on multiple devices at the
same time.

[Heterogeneous Inference](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/hetero-execution):  
enables splitting inference among several devices automatically, for example, if one device
doesn't support certain operations.

[Automatic Batching](../../openvino-workflow/running-inference/inference-devices-and-modes/automatic-batching):  
automatically groups inference requests to improve device utilization.
